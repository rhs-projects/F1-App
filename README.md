# F1 App Clone

This project is a Formula 1 app clone, built using React Native, designed to provide users with essential information about Formula 1 races, including race schedules, driver standings, and more. It's a mobile app that showcases a sleek user interface powered by a robust GraphQL API, and integrates IBM StepZen for seamless data querying.

The app is created to mimic the official Formula 1 mobile app, with a focus on delivering accurate and up-to-date race data. The project is based on a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/live/WBK26V3PdtM?si=8lmGB4aZM_2q1gaG) by **[Vadim Savin]** and serves as a learning project.

## Technologies Used
